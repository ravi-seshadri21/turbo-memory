This project primarily focusses on making your resume more ATS reliant, it provides the user with keywords to be used and transform their resume as per the job description stated as well as providing the user with a descriptive summary of their uploaded resume file.
I have used Gemini 2.5 Pro for this project and pyton version 3.12
For running this project streamlit is a most convenient and simple way to show in production.
